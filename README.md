# My Flutter Graphql First APP

A new Flutter project to try implemented graphql

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I use `github API` for this project. So, you need to prepare your github secret token if you want to continue. 

## Copy the secret file

To run this project properly please copy the secret example to secret dart file you can do this command on your main project folder: 

```bash
cp secret.dart.example secret.dart
```

Don't forget to add your github token to the kToken.
